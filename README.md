# Logistic Regression on Titanic Dataset 🚢

## Overview
This project applies **Logistic Regression** to predict passenger survival on the **Titanic** using the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset includes various features like passenger class, age, gender, and more. The model aims to classify passengers as **survived (1) or not survived (0)** based on these features.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). It contains:
- **Survival** (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass** (Passenger class: 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Sex** (Male/Female)
- **Age** (Passenger’s age in years)
- **SibSp** (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- **Parch** (Number of parents/children aboard)
- **Fare** (Ticket fare price)
- **Embarked** (Port of embarkation: C, Q, S)

## Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing data distributions
   - Checking feature correlations
3. **Model Training:**
   - Splitting data into train/test sets
   - Applying **Logistic Regression**
   - Evaluating model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
4. **Predictions & Insights:**
   - Making survival predictions
   - Understanding feature importance

## Results
- Achieved an **accuracy of ~80%** (varies based on preprocessing techniques).
- **Gender** and **passenger class** were strong predictors of survival.
